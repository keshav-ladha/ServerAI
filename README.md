THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF THREE FILES:
    - server.js
    - commandR.py (basically commandRunner.py)
    - commands.txt

 - server.js takes an input from the user and writes it down in the 'commands.txt' file.
 - commands.txt stores the commands given by the user.
 - commandR.py reads the commands Given by the user and performs accordingly.

To Run This Program Perfectly :
    - Run The server.js in a separate terminal. 
        - this would ask you to enter your command and then write it in the 'commands.txt' file.
    - Run The commandR.py file in a seperate terminal.
        - this would just run and do the task when anything is written in 'commands.txt'.
